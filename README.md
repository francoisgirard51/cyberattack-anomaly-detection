## <u>Disclaimer</u>

This repository, **cyberattack-anomaly-detection**, and all related materials have been created by Francois GIRARD, a student at "Le Wagon", exclusively for educational and skill development purposes.

### Purpose:
The primary aim of this project is to engage in learning and practicing deep learning and data analysis techniques. It is an academic endeavor with no commercial intent.

### Data Sources:
The datasets used in this project are courtesy of **University of New South Wales** (UNSW) and **University of New Brunswick** (UNB) research teams (see "Licenses" for references). These datasets are publicly accessible and developed for research and academic use, adhering to their specific terms of use which exclude commercial exploitation.

### Non-Commercial Usage:
I hereby declare that this project, including all its contents and outcomes, is not intended for any commercial use. Its sole purpose is for my personal education, to enhance my skills in deep learning, and for academic research. There is no intention to violate the rights of the dataset providers or to derive commercial benefit from the datasets or their derivatives.

### Acknowledgments:
Sincere thanks are extended to **Dr Nickolaos Koroniotis (UNSW)**, **Dr Nour Moustafa (UNSW)**, **Dr Ali Akbar Ghorbani (UNB)**, **Dr Ebrahim Bagheri (UNB)**, **Dr Wei Lu (UNB)** and **Dr Mahbod Tavallaee (UNB)** for making their valuable datasets available for educational purposes. Their contribution to the academic and research community is highly appreciated.

### Contact:
Should there be any inquiries or concerns regarding the use of the datasets or the nature of this project, please feel free to reach out to me at francoisgirard51@gmail.com.
